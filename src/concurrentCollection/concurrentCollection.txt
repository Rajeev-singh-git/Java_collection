                    Need of Concurrent collection

If one thread is working on collection object and other thread comes
and modifies data, there may be problem of data inconsistency.

Data inconsistency problem

To overcome data inconsistency problem, java use "SYNCHRONIZED"
blocks or methods, so that only one thread can use that block
or object at only one time.

To overcome performance problem in old java collection way of synchronization
java introduced Concurrent collection.

                       ConcurrentModificationException

If one thread is iterating over collection and at the same time
if another thread is modifying same collection object, there is possibility
the programme will throw ConcurrentModificationException.
